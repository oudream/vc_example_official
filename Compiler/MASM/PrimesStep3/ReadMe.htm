In addition, the settings for the <b>Additional Dependencies</b> box lists the .asm include file. This assembles the .asm file if either the .asm file or the .asm include file is new than the object file generated by <b>Custom Build Step</b>.</p><p>To view these settings, right-click the .asm file and click <b>Properties</b>. These settings, which support including the .asm file in the build, have already been entered for you.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="heading">Building and Running the Sample</h1><div id="sectionSection0" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><h4 class="subHeading">To build and run this sample</h4><div class="subSection"><ol><li><p>Open the solution PrimesStep3.sln.</p></li><li><p>On the <b>Build</b> menu, click <b>Build</b>.</p></li><li><p>On the <b>Debug</b> menu, click <b>Start Without Debugging</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>You can use this sample to explore Visual C++ support for mixed C/C++ and ASM projects, such as using the <b>Custom Build Step</b> tab in the <b>Properties</b> dialog box and debugging .asm files at a source level.
