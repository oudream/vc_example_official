The MFC Binder sample is an SDI application that uses the <b>COleDocObjectItem</b> class to represent an embedded Active document in an MFC document. MFCBIND works much like the Office Binder application, which ships with Microsoft Office.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="heading">Building and Running the Sample</h1><div id="sectionSection0" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><h4 class="subHeading">To build and run the MFCBIND sample</h4><div class="subSection"><ol><li><p>Open the solution mfcbind.sln.</p></li><li><p>On the <b>Build</b> menu, click <b>Build</b>.</p></li><li><p>Start the application and click the <b>Add</b> menu item from the <b>Section</b> menu to add to the binder as many sections as you want.  </p><p>Image, Word, and Excel documents are examples of sections. When you add a section to the binder, you can edit it directly from within the MFC Binder application as though you were working in the section's native application.  </p></li><li><p>When you finish editing the sections in the binder, save the binder by clicking <b>Save</b> on the <b>File</b> menu. <b>Save</b> saves the sections in the binder to a single file. When you reopen the binder later, the sections are available in their previously saved state.</p></li></ol></div></div><h1 class="heading">Active Documents in MFC</h1><div id="sectionSection1" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>In MFC, Active documents are handled much the same way regular in-place editable embeddings are handled. The <b>COleDocument</b>-derived class still maintains a list of the currently embedded items. The <b>COleClientItem</b> object, which is replaced by the <b>COleClientItem</b>-derived <b>COleDocObjectItem</b> class, represents the embedded item in the <b>COleDocument</b>. It is these <b>COleDocObjectItem</b>-derived items that are maintained in a list by the <b>COleDocument</b>-derived class. Active documents, however, take up the entire client area of the view when they are in-place active. An Active document container also has full control of the Help menu, unlike the older in-place embeddings. The Help menu contains menu items for both the Active document container and server. Because the Active document container owns the Help menu, it is responsible for forwarding messages for the server's part of the Help menu to the server. The help menu merging and message forwarding functionality is completely handled by the MFC framework.</p></div><h1 class="heading">Keywords</h1><div id="sectionSection2" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><p>This sample demonstrates the following keywords: </p><p>COleClientItem::FinishCreate, COleClientItem::GetIconFromRegistry, IOleObject::GetUserClassID, COleClientItem::OnChange, COleClientItem::OnChangeItemPosition, COleClientItem::OnGetItemPosition, COleClientItem::OnActivate, COleDocument::GetInPlaceActiveItem, COleClientItem::Deactivate, COleClientItem::CreateNewItem, COleClientItem::DoVerb, COleDocObjectItem::COleDocObjectItem, COleClientItem::CreateFromFile, COleClientItem::Activate, COleDocObjectItem::OnPreparePrintin, COleDocObjectItem::OnPrint, SystemParametersInfo, MeasureItem, DrawItem, GetSystemMetrics, SelectObject</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>Some samples, such as this one, have not been modified to reflect the changes in the Visual C++ wizards, libraries, and compiler, but still demonstrate how to complete your desired task. </p></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footerLine"></div>
